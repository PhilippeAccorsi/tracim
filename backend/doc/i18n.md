# Internationalisation(i18n) of tracim Backend.

Actually the way internationalisation of tracim_backend work is using json file from [locale subdir](../tracim_backend/locale).
those json file are now generated from po file generated by babel.

## Initialisation

### add need language translation

if you want to add a new language, do something like this :

    python setup.py extract_messages
    python setup.py init_catalog -l "de"

_de_ is iso639 for german langage, that's an example. you should choose the correct one for
the one you add (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
that's just an example

### update langage translation

If you want to update langage translation of german translation for example you need to do this.
you first need to update .po translation file:

    python setup.py extract_messages
    python setup.py update_catalog

## add translations

you now can edit po file like "tracim_backend/locale/_de_/LC_MESSAGES/tracim_backend.po" to set translation string.

## create/overwrite json file from .po

### install i18n-conv to convert .po file as json i18next compatible file

to overwrite json file you need i18n-conv tool.

    sudo npm install i18next-conv -g

### create/overwrite json files

json file should be place in place like tracim_backend/locale/_de_/backend.json.
to do this, you can run this script in backend folder:

    ./update_i18n_json_file.sh
